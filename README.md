# Bicycle price infographic generator

I presented this project at the Gunn High School Engineering Night in May 2016, organized by computer science teacher Josh Paley.

The purpose of the event was to

> ...show people possibilities in engineering.  It is also to make plain what engineering is.  You might be surprised to learn how many people in Palo Alto don't know what it means.  It seems strange to me that a person can go through high school without building anything.  Perhaps if more people knew what engineering was and its importance to society, this might change.

We were to assume that the audience had zero technical knowledge, so I only discusses my approach to the problem, not the implementation.

I made a version of the infographic suitable for projecting, with larger text and a black background. In the presentation, I discussed these points: (list numbers do not correspond to slides)

1. the problem - lots of bike brands, lots of models, lots of versions
1. the goal - gain general insight, look for price trends
1. how to measure value - price versus performance, and how those can be quantified
1. building the infographic
1. what we can learn from a zoomed-in region of the infographic
1. results - I did gain insight, but did not find any price trends
1. and that's okay - knowing there is no trend is just as valuable as knowing there is
