A fully automatic Python version of the Javascript scraper.

Uses [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) and [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/).

Other files:

* `log.txt`: console output printed when scraping, showing all the bikes scraped.
* `models.pickle`: the data from scraping serialized so you don't have to scrape it again.
