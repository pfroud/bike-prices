These are Javascript tools to help scrape data about bikes from each brand. They are not fully automated.

I made one fully automated scraper, at [specialized/python_version/](specialized/python_version/). It was more work than I thought it would be.


**Version counts**
* Cannondale: 37
* Giant: 27
* Specialized: 74
* Trek: 52
* Total: 190
